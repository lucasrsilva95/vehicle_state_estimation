# vehicle_state_estimation
This code was developed in the final project of the course "State Estimation and Localization for Self-Driving Cars", that is the second course of the Self-Driving Car Specialization offered by the University of Toronto.

The project goal was to implement the Error-State Extended Kalman Filter (ES-EKF) to localize a vehicle using data from the CARLA simulator.
